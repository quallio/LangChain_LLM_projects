Sternberg, 2000\\n\\nMany formal and informal deﬁnitions of intelligence have been proposed over the past few decades, although there is no existing scientiﬁc consensus around any single deﬁnition. Sternberg & Detterman noted in 1986 [87] that when two dozen prominent psychologists were asked to deﬁne intelligence, they all gave somewhat divergent answers. In the context of AI research, Legg and Hutter [53] summarized in 2007 no fewer than 70 deﬁnitions from the literature into a single statement: “Intelligence measures an agent’s ability to achieve goals in a wide range of environments.”'"
